<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a podcast app that has the same thing as Instapaper’s “Random Shake”? That is, where I can either shake my iPhone or tap a button and the app will select a random episode from my queue to listen to?</p>&mdash; Richard Brynjólfsson (@sillygwailo) <a href="https://twitter.com/sillygwailo/status/983054664747900931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
