How would one go about converting an existing static website to a Jekyll-produced static website, keeping all URLs the same?

  <p>To elaborate: most (all?) of the tutorials assume you're converting from a dynamic CMS like WordPress or Drupal. What if you had an old blog, powered by Movable Type, and you lost the database to it, but you still had all the static files it generated and maybe wanted to start it up again? Just as a random example.</p>
