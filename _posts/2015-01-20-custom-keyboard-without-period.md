In Safari on iOS, I almost always search and almost never type in URLs. Typing in URLs is the main reason for having the period next to the space on the keyboard. When searching, I constantly type the period instead of a space, though, and, even though search engines have caught on, I still don't want my search terms separated by dots. So is there a custom keyboard that I can use for the address bar of Safari that doesn’t have a period?

If [I were to built my own custom keyboard](https://www.weheartswift.com/make-custom-keyboard-ios-8-using-swift/), this would be the first one I’d build.
