<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there an Apple Watch face that doesn’t tell time? That is, no “watch” or “clock” or anything that shows what time it is when I raise it? I’d be OK with a watch face that has a cool representation of the current time but I’d have to decode it (I would never bother).</p>&mdash; Richard Terroriksson (@sillygwailo) <a href="https://twitter.com/sillygwailo/status/1044605988613967873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
