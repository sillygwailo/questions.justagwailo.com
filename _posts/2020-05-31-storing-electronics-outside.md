I’ve spent the last week eating dinner outside on my balcony. With the pandemic not abating as fast as I thought it would in Toronto, I’m doubling down on spending time out there. I have a “patio” storage box on the way, intended for things I don’t want to go in and out for.

Could I leave a Kindle and a charging cable outside, in the box, and in a plastic bag, during the warmer months? Maybe a portable speaker?
