I have a question about employees of startup incubators/accelerators at https://readmill.com/sillygwailo/reads/these-days/highlights/eyg2vw #24hourbookclub

Since July 1st, 2014, Readmill has been closed. It did offer a very generous data export, in the form of an ePub copy of a reader's highlights and notes in the form of a user story. Here's a screenshot the notes that was at that above URL (now 404).

![Richard Eriksson Poly is a startup incubator (short for Polymorph) and this is Sophie is describing a role to Connor, the role being a designer to be shared around with the startups in the incubator. How prevalent is that role within startup incubators/accelerators? That is, an employee working for the incubator but doing work for the startups?

Henrik BerggrenHenrik Berggren I think this is becoming more and more a thing. Both incubators and VC's are starting to hire people to support their companies. The prime example right now is probably Andreesen Horowitz which apparently have 45 people in their org. which are supporting their investments on various topics. http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/02/15/andreessen-horowitz-transcript/
